# Project information

This is just another simple tool for creating timetables. It will create a new Google calendar with your timetable you
inserted before. This makes it easier for you to create and maintain your current timetable for school or university.
So feel free to try it and find the bugs. It is free to use and will not track any of your data.

# Privacy

The application does not collect any of your data, except the data that is collected by Google itself. But the host of
the application is not able to collect any data, because it is a frontend only application with no backend that would be 
able to collect your data.

# Further development

This project will be not developed actively. But because I am also a student with my personal needs, this application 
might be updated as soon as I want to make my live easier :)
